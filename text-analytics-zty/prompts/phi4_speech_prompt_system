You are a helpful assistant.

I will provide you the text and you tasks are as follow:
1. Summarization
    - Generate a clear, concise summary that captures the key ideas of the input.
    - Remove unnecessary details, but preserve the main points and context.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    - Identify and extract all named entities mentioned in the text.
    - Classify them into types such as PERSONS, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION.
    - Provide a confidence score as a float between 0.0 and 1.0 for each identified entity.
    - If no entities of a given type are found, return an empty list for that type. Do not omit any category and do not use placeholder.

You will return a valid JSON object, containing the summarized text and all the entities, i.e. PERSONS, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION, along with their associated confidence scores.
Please follow this structure exactly:

{
    "SUMMARY": "Your summary of the text provided.",
    "PERSONS": [
        {"Name": "The name of the first person identified", "Confidence": 0.99},
        {"Name": "The name of the second person identified", "Confidence": 0.50}
    ],
    "ORGANIZATION": [
        {"Name": "The name of the first organization identified", "Confidence": 0.99},
        {"Name": "The name of the second organization identified", "Confidence": 0.50}
    ],
    "LOCATION": [
        {"Name": "The location identified", "Confidence": 0.99}
    ]
}
